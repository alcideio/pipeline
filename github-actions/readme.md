# Github Actions| Security Scanning Kubernetes Cluster & Workloads Hygiene

Alcide Advisor is an agentless Kubernetes audit, compliance and hygiene scanner thatâ€™s built to ensure a friciton free DevSecOps workflows. Alcide Advisor can be plugged early in the development process and before moving to production.

With Alcide Advisor, the security checks you can cover includes:

- Kubernetes infrastructure vulnerability scanning.
- Hunting misplaced secrets, or excessive priviliges for secret access.
- Workload hardening from Pod Security to network policies.
- Istio security configuration and best practices.
- Ingress Controllers for security best practices.
- Kubernetes API server access privileges.
- Kubernetes operators security best practices.
- Deployment conformance to labeling, annotating, resource limits and much more ...

Alcide Advisor security checks are being added and updated on a regular basis.

## Github Actions Integration

Alcide Kubernetes Advisor runs against a kubernetes cluster and requires access to `kubeconfig`
to authenticate & authorize itself to the cluster.

If your pipeline can run kubectl commands against the cluster successfully - you should be ready to initiate a scan.

#### *Github Actions* Pipeline Example

The example below shows how to use *Alcide Advisor* pipeline mode to scan a helm chart deployed to a locally created k8s KIND cluster.
